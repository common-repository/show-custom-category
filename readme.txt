Add specific or all categories to post pages with a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

You can use this plugin to show specific or all categories of a post
A meta box with the name "show categories" will be automatically added to your edit/new post dashboard
containing two fields.
* The first field allows you to select which categories you wish to appear on this post page. It is easy and you can separate them with slashes (/). If you wish to display all categories, leave it blank. for example: news/world news/what's new
* The second field allows you to add classes for your custom style.
Finally, just add [sven_category] where you want them to appear on your post page 

(note: this plugin now only works for posts)
== Installation ==
Upload the plugin to your blog, activate it.
You're done!
